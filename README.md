Bunk Churn Prediction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
Bunk Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting student churn in educational institutions. By analyzing various factors such as attendance records, academic performance, and socio-economic background, this project helps identify students who are at risk of dropping out or "bunking" classes. The predictive model built in this project can assist educational institutions in implementing proactive interventions to reduce student dropout rates and improve student retention.
